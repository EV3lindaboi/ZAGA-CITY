Description             : The Order has designed a battleground on a remote
                          mountain lake, known as Zaga, in order to deploy
                          people that attempted to overthrow the regime, and
                          watch them fight each other for their own
                          amusement.
                          
                          A very very late release of Zaga for Strife.
                          Zaga is a Deathmatch map whose purpose is to be
                          ported to more first person shooters. More details
